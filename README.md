# **Street Food**
The two apps (**Street Food consumer** and **Street Food Admin**) are part of an integrated ecosystem. The user app allows consumers to place orders, which are then received and managed through the admin app by the restaurant staff.

These two application is developed to explore Firebase's capabilities and to create a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) as a practical learning experience.
    
 # Street Food (Consumer):
 - This app is designed for consumers who wish to order food for delivery  from their favorite local street food vendors. It provides a convenient platform where users can browse menus, place orders, and track deliveries, all from a single interface.
